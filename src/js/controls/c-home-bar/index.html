<h1>Mountain Flag</h1>
<p>The manager can create one or more crowdsourcing campaigns. A campaign has a name, some configuration parameters and a set of input images. Aim of the campaign is the annotation of images with the skyline of the landscape. A preliminary step allows workers to validate or discard the images to be annotated: only the images that contain a mountain profile will pass this first stage and therefore are selected; they will be then annotated. Each task is executed by a set of workers; the assignment of the images to each worker is decided by means of a scheduling algorithm, which is based on parameters associated with the campaign (the algorithm needs not be realized and will be provided through APIs).</p>
